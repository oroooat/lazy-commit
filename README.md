## Chapter I: The Peculiar Case of the Automated Git Commit

In the meticulously organized world of software development, where every pixel must be perfectly aligned and every commit message follows the sacred conventions of the ancient Git masters, there exists a most extraordinary tool. The Lazy-Commit, much like the inhabitants of the Royal Tenenbaums estate, possesses an uncanny ability to transform the mundane into the magnificent.

**Starring:**
- **OpenRouter AI** as *The Distinguished Cloud Provider*  
- **Ollama** as *The Eccentric Local Genius*  
- **Your Git Repository** as *The Grand Hotel Repository*

## Appendix: Behind the Scenes

This tool employs a sophisticated AI-powered system to analyze your Git diffs and generate conventional commit messages. Like a well-rehearsed ensemble cast, it supports multiple AI providers, remembers your preferences, validates for security concerns, and provides an editing suite worthy of a master craftsman.

The result? Commit messages so precise, so beautifully formatted, that they could be framed and hung in the lobby of The Grand Budapest Hotel.
